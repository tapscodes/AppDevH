# AppDevH
All My App Development Honors Projects in Senior Year of Highschool (2019-2020). 
## Projects
Most projects have their assignment pdf attached, and other than the first few, they were all written in swift. Please note some of the projects didn't get perfect grades, as they aren't perfect programs. The .aia files are from MIT App Inventor 2 (which was used before swift)

## Warning
These projects are publicly visible for future reference. This code is 100% mine, so feel free to use it. I personally won't come after you for using this, but your boss/administration might, as copying my code would technically be considered plagiarizing in certain cases.
