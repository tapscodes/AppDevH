/*GENERAL NOTES:
-LAYOUT TESTED+WORKING ON iPad Pro (3rd gen, 12.9 in), iPhone 6, iPhone 8, iPhone X (all the gens that can be tested with the simulator)
 -Went a different route of more of a "self-study"/motivated user that would simply check their own answers and study until they were confident (no score, highscore, timer, etc.), simply tells them they were wrong, and they can skip problems at will
-Press Cmd+k to show the keyboard a normal phone would have, using normal keyboard breaks app, as it was designed for a phone(with a forced number pad), so having the letters of a normal keyboard (only possible in the emualtor) breaks the application in various ways.
-As stated in startController, my plans for custom timesTables failed, so I simply set it to the default 12x tables. (Upper+Lower bounds would've been set correct though)
